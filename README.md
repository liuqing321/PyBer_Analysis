# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis 
In this analysis, we will use Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that could show the total weekly fares for each city type. And then, we will investigate the relationship between the total weekly fares and the city types. Finally, we will research how the data differ by city type and how those differecens can be used by decision-maker at Pyber.  

## Results

* The urban area has the most amount of drivers and the most amount of rides. The rural area has the least amount of drivers and the least amount of rides.

* Total fare in urban area is much more higher than the total fare in suburban area or in the rural area. 

* However, the urban area has the lowest average fare per driver and the lowest average fare per ride. The rural area has the highest average fare per ride and the highest average fare per driver.

* From the graph above, we can see that the urban area has the highest fare, and the fare  of suburban area is second to the fare of the urban area. The rural area has the lowest fare. 


* In urban area, the highest fare happened in February and March. And the lowest fare happened in January. 

* In suburban area, the highest fare happened in February. The lowest fare happened in January. 

* In rural area, the highest fare happened in April. The lowest fare happened in January.

## Summary 

* There is a tendency of involution in the urban area. The urban area has the most amount of drivers and the most amount of rides. The total fare in urban area is much more higher than the total fare in suburban area and the rural area. But the urban area has the lowest average fare per driver and the lowest average fare per ride are. This phenomenon suggests that the competition among the urban area drivers is very tense. To attract more passengers, the drivers are willing to lower the fare and extend their working hours. However,the actions of lowering fare and extending working hours didn't bring much profit to both Pyber and the drivers. To limit such improper competition, the CEO of Pyber should set up the lowest fare limit in urban area. 

* The rural area has the least amount of driver and the least amount of rides. That means the market of the rural area has not been fully exploited. The CEO of Pyber could invest more in the marketing for rural area, especially for the rural cities with tourist sights.

* The highest fare and the lowest fare happened in different month for different areas. Pyber could adjust the fare according to the usage in different time and different areas. For example, increasing the lowest fare during the rush hour or after midnight in the urban areas.
